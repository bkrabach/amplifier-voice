## 6. Key Trends for 2025-2026

### Autonomous AI Agents
Unlike chatbots with pre-programmed scenarios, autonomous agents understand context and intent, respond conversationally, and resolve issues independently. They act as independent team members, deflecting cases or seamlessly handing off complex issues.

### Assistive AI for Agents
Personal AI assistants for service reps that summarize conversations, generate case notes, and provide real-time coaching. Enables agents to focus on customer relationships rather than administrative tasks.

### Voice as Digital Channel
Integrating voice into unified platforms enables real-time transcription, AI-powered analytics, and omnichannel workflows. Phone becomes a data-rich digital channel like chat.

### Proactive Service
AI shifts from reactive to proactive - anticipating customer needs, offering relevant suggestions, and preventing issues before they occur.
